# Hospital-Analysis
MGT-151R project by Ansh, Jeronimo, Jeremy, Jonathon, &amp; Genevieve


The data we have selected for this project regarding hospital data analysis comes from the following [link](https://vitaldb.net/dataset/?query=overview). In short, this data is collected from Korean hospital data and is inter-operative, meaning during the operation from 6,388 individual surgeries. That is the number of entries we have in our dataset. The available information includes high frequency biosensor data such as biosigns throughout the procedures, and this data is paired with outcomes and related medical records. We accessed the data through the site's [API](https://api.vitaldb.net/cases), from which we saved the clinical information data as a .csv file in our repository.

After surfing through the data, we collectively came up with a few questions to answer with this data: 
- Is there a correlation between BMI and surgery suvival rate?
- What is the relationship between patient pre-surgery metrics such as age, hypertension, diabetes, and ASA Score and the post-surgical outcome?
- What is the relationship between surgery type and recovery period and outcome?
- Are certain departments more likely to use specific typeds of surgical methods? (Ex: Do gynecology-related surgeries use robotic surgieres at a higher rate than general surgeries?)
